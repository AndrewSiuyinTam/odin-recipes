    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is for the maple curry chicken dish. It is my personal favorite.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds chicken wings</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li> 
        <li> 1 cup tomato-based hot pepper sauce </li>
        <li>1 yellow bell pepper, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons vinegar-based hot pepper sauce</li>
        <li> 2 cups cubed cooked chicken breast meat </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li> 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li> 3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor or indoor grill to a high heat. Lightly grease the grill.</li>
        <li>Season wings with garlic powder and ground black pepper. Cook wings on the preheated grill until they are very crispy. Turn the wings frequently as they will burn easily.</li>
        <li>While the wings are grilling, in a large bowl, combine both hot sauces with garlic powder, Parmesan cheese and melted butter.</li>
        <li>When the wings are finished cooking, place them in the large bowl of hot sauce mixture and stir until they are coated.</li>
    </ol>
